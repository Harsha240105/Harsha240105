## 👋 Hi, I'm Harshavardhan H S

I'm a BCA student at Soundarya Management & Science College, Bengaluru, currently pursuing my 5th semester. I enjoy building AI-powered tools, automation projects, bots, and real-world applications that solve practical problems.

I’ve worked on projects such as healthcare insurance claiming using Blockchain, WhatsApp AI group-broadcast automation, college-based Discord systems, Blockchain activity tracking for students, and a complete e-commerce website. I'm also exploring crypto utilities, video editing workflows, animation, and cyber-crime investigation tools.

I’m always learning, experimenting, and building something new with AI, automation, and modern technologies. I also use modern developer tools like GitHub Copilot, GPT-based assistants, and AI-driven workflows to improve my coding and project development.
